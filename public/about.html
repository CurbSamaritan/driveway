<h1>Welcome to Curb Samaritan</h1>

<p>How many times has your car gotten towed?  How many times have you left your lights on or a window open?<p>

<p>You wish that someone had told you.</p>

<p>And similarly, how many times have you seen a parked car in some sort of trouble &mdash; parked in a tow-away zone or its lights on or a window rolled down?</p>

<p>You wish that you could have told the owner.</p>

<h1>You <em>could</em> put your cell-phone number in the window</h1>

<p>Tape a sign with the number in the rear window.  That way, a good Samaritan passing by could call you
or text you and say, &ldquo;Hey, buddy, you left your window open and it looks like rain!&rdquo;<p>

<p>You could, but it is so obviously a bad idea, no one ever would do that.  The chance of some nut
getting your phone number and using it to make your life miserable is just too high.</p>

<h1>This is where Curb Samaritan comes in</h1>

<p>You give <em>us</em> your number.  (We are not nuts, we are not going to crank-call
you.)  We give you a little sign to post in your rear window.  The sign shows
<em>our</em> special code for you.  When the Samaritan texts us, giving us your
code and tell us the problem, we text you.  You never see the Samaritan&rsquo;s number
and more important, no one ever sees yours!</p>


<h1>How much does it cost?</h1>

<p>Right now, nothing.  In the future, we may explore -- with your prior permission -- some discreet marketing opportunities, but for now, it is as free as rainbows and sunshine.</p>

<h1>It is really free?</h1>

<p>Yup, although if you are so inclined, you could <a href="http://is.gd/michaellorton" target="_blank">buy my book</a></p>
